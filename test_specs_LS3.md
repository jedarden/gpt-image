# Test Specifications for `backend/package.json` (Layer LS3)

These test specifications define the required behaviors and properties for the `backend/package.json` file, ensuring compatibility, completeness, and maintainability for the backend Node.js/TypeScript/Express application.

---

## 1. Dependency and DevDependency Verification

### 1.1 Required Dependencies
- The `dependencies` section SHOULD include:
  - `express`
  - `axios`
  - `express-rate-limit`
- All listed dependencies SHOULD have versions compatible with the backend codebase and with each other.

### 1.2 Required DevDependencies
- The `devDependencies` section SHOULD include:
  - `typescript`
  - `ts-node`
  - `nodemon` (if used for development)
  - `jest`
  - `ts-jest`
  - `supertest`
  - `@types/express`
  - `@types/node`
  - `@types/jest`
  - `@types/supertest`
- All listed devDependencies SHOULD have versions compatible with the backend codebase, TypeScript, and Jest.
- Any additional dependencies/devDependencies required for backend compatibility (e.g., for linting, environment management) SHOULD be present.

### 1.3 Completeness and Compatibility
- All dependencies and devDependencies referenced in backend source code, TypeScript config, or Jest config MUST be present in `package.json`.
- No unused or extraneous dependencies SHOULD be present.

---

## 2. NPM Scripts Functionality

### 2.1 Script Presence
- The `scripts` section MUST define the following scripts:
  - `"dev"`: Runs the backend in development mode using `ts-node` or `nodemon` with TypeScript.
  - `"build"`: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript using `tsc`.
  - `"start"`: Runs the compiled backend using `node` from the build output directory.
  - `"test"`: Runs all backend tests using `jest` (with `ts-jest` and correct test directory structure).

### 2.2 Script Behavior
- Running `npm run dev` SHOULD start the backend in development mode, supporting live reload if `nodemon` is used.
- Running `npm run build` SHOULD produce a valid JavaScript build in the configured output directory.
- Running `npm start` after build SHOULD start the backend server in production mode from the build output.
- Running `npm test` SHOULD execute all backend tests using Jest and report results.

### 2.3 Script Compatibility
- All scripts MUST be compatible with the TypeScript configuration in [`backend/tsconfig.json`](backend/tsconfig.json:1) and the Jest setup in [`backend/jest.config.js`](backend/jest.config.js:1).
- Scripts SHOULD fail gracefully with clear error messages if misconfigured.

---

## 3. TypeScript and Jest Configuration Compatibility

- The `package.json` configuration (dependencies, scripts) MUST be compatible with:
  - The TypeScript configuration in [`backend/tsconfig.json`](backend/tsconfig.json:1)
  - The Jest configuration in [`backend/jest.config.js`](backend/jest.config.js:1)
- All TypeScript and Jest features used in the backend codebase MUST be supported by the installed dependencies and scripts.

---

## 4. Backend Server Start Verification

### 4.1 Development Mode
- After running `npm install` and `npm run dev`, the backend server SHOULD start successfully in development mode, serving API endpoints as expected.

### 4.2 Production Mode
- After running `npm run build` and `npm start`, the backend server SHOULD start successfully in production mode, serving API endpoints as expected.

### 4.3 Error Handling
- If required dependencies or scripts are missing, running the relevant npm scripts SHOULD fail with clear, actionable error messages.

---

## 5. Documentation and Comments

- The `package.json` file MUST include documentation/comments for:
  - The purpose of each npm script (e.g., using a `"//"` property or similar convention).
  - Any non-obvious dependencies or configuration choices.
- Documentation/comments SHOULD be clear, concise, and help developers understand the structure and purpose of the file.

---

## 6. General Validity

- The `package.json` file MUST be valid JSON and well-formatted.
- Running `npm install` in the backend directory with this file present SHOULD succeed without errors or warnings.

---

## 7. Regression and Edge Cases

- Removing or altering any required dependency, devDependency, or script SHOULD cause the relevant tests to fail.
- The test suite SHOULD include checks for:
  - Missing or incompatible dependency versions.
  - Broken or missing npm scripts.
  - Incomplete or missing documentation/comments.

---

## 8. Test Coverage and Maintainability

- All requirements above MUST be covered by corresponding tests (manual or automated).
- Test specifications SHOULD be updated if backend requirements or configurations change.
