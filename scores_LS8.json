    "docker_image_minimization": {
      "score": 6,
      "rationale": "Backend Dockerfile is not production-optimized (uses node:lts, runs in dev mode, exposes wrong port). Multi-stage/minimal images are recommended but not fully implemented. However, the structure is sound and only minor changes are needed."

      "score": 8,
      "rationale": "Trivy is integrated into CI and used for vulnerability scanning. The only issue is the cache key could be more granular, but this is a minor optimization."

    "static_file_path_resolution": {
      "score": 7,
      "rationale": "Static file path resolution is flexible and environment-aware, but lacks validation for directory existence, which could lead to runtime errors if misconfigured."

      "score": 8,
      "rationale": "Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date, but omits details on CI security (Trivy) and multi-arch Docker builds. These are minor gaps in otherwise strong documentation."
