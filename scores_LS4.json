    "performance": "Builds both backend and frontend images using Buildx, but lacks build caching, parallelism, and multi-architecture support. Sequential execution reduces efficiency.",
    "correctness": "Meets core requirements for building and pushing images, uses secrets, and triggers on main/master. Minor issue with $GITHUB_SHA usage and missing tag/release triggers.",
    "maintainability": "Workflow is well-documented, clear, and follows best practices. Some commented-out code and lack of job modularity reduce maintainability.",
    "security": "Handles secrets securely and avoids credential leaks, but does not scan images for vulnerabilities before pushing."
