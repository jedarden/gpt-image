      "score": 5,
      "rationale": "Matrix builds per-arch instead of a single multi-arch manifest reduce efficiency. Double build (build, scan, then build/push) increases CI time. Caching is present but uses ephemeral paths, reducing effectiveness. Opportunities for DRY and further optimization are noted."

    "correctness": {
      "score": 6,
      "rationale": "Tagging logic covers main cases but may miss edge cases (PRs, non-semver, forks). No true multi-arch manifest; images are per-arch. TDD spec not directly referenced, but workflow is robust for mainline scenarios."
    },
    "maintainability": {
      "score": 7,
      "rationale": "Well-commented and modular, but repeated steps (no YAML anchors/aliases) and no job timeouts. Suggestions for further modularity and clarity are present."

    "security": {
      "score": 8,
      "rationale": "No hardcoded secrets; uses GITHUB_TOKEN. Trivy version is pinned to a minor version (could miss updates). OIDC not used, but no major security lapses."
