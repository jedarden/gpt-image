  "rationales": {
    "performance": "Artifact reuse and persistent Docker build cache are implemented, but cache key granularity is suboptimal (uses commit SHA instead of hashing relevant files), reducing cache hit rates.",
    "correctness": "Multi-arch manifest builds and robust tag extraction are present, but duplicate step IDs can cause Trivy to scan the wrong image, and fallback tag sanitization may produce invalid Docker tags for unusual refs.",
    "maintainability": "YAML anchors and extensive comments improve maintainability, but duplicate step IDs and lack of Trivy report artifact upload reduce clarity and auditability.",
    "security": "OIDC authentication is used (no static secrets), secrets are not exposed, and Trivy is pinned to a stable version. Minor note: ensure all third-party actions are always pinned."
