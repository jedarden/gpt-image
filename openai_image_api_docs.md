# OpenAI Image Generation API Documentation

## Retrieval Attempt

Attempts were made to fetch the latest OpenAI image generation API documentation and example requests from [https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create) using `curl` with and without a browser user-agent.

**Result:**  
Both attempts returned a Cloudflare "Just a moment..." page, which is a JavaScript-based anti-bot protection mechanism. This page cannot be bypassed using standard CLI tools like `curl` because it requires a real browser environment with JavaScript and cookies enabled.

## Next Steps

To obtain the latest documentation and example requests, please visit the following URL in your web browser:

- [OpenAI Image Generation API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create)

You can then manually copy the relevant documentation and example requests into this file if needed.
